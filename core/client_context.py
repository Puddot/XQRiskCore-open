    ClientContext â€” Institutional Execution Shell
    =============================================

    This class encapsulates the entire operational environment for a single client portfolio.

    - Portfolio state
    - Risk engine stack
    - Market data interface
    - Trade execution tracking
    - Audit and compliance infrastructure

    It is the runtime wrapper for all strategy execution, user interactions, and system enforcement.
