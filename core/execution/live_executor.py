        Real execution flow via broker:

        Step 1. üì§ Submit order to broker  
            - Send order based on intent (symbol, quantity, action)  
            - Measure roundtrip latency (ms)  
            - Retrieve executed price and estimated price for slippage calculation

        Step 2. üíº Update portfolio state  
            - Add executed trade into portfolio  
            - Track slippage against expected price  
            - Log portfolio update

        Step 3. üßæ Record execution details  
            - Estimate commission  
            - Save to TradeManager: price, slippage, latency, source, intent_id

        Step 4. üìä Update live risk monitors  
            - Trigger valuation and drawdown recalculation

        Step 5. üß† Finalize execution context  
            - Record all trade result details into context  
            - Status: EXECUTED  
            - Reason: Broker execution confirmed  
            - Include full metadata (timestamps, slippage, commission)

        Step 6. üìù Write audit log and persist state  
            - Log execution record  
            - Save updated client state
