"""
DryRunExecutor — Simulated Execution Handler
============================================

This executor simulates trades without sending real orders.  
It is primarily used for backtesting, sandbox trading, and non-destructive system validation.

Execution results are written to:
- Portfolio state
- TradeManager
- Structured audit logs

⚠️ Source code intentionally hidden.  
✅ Fully operational in dry-run environments.

        Dry-run execution lifecycle:

        Step 1. 🏷️ Mark executor type  
            - Identify as DryRunExecutor in the context

        Step 2. 📈 Fetch market price  
            - Get current price and timestamp from market provider

        Step 3. 💸 Simulate slippage  
            - Apply ±0.1% price adjustment based on buy/sell direction  
            - Compute final executed price

        Step 4. 📊 Update portfolio state  
            - Add trade to client portfolio  
            - Store slippage and trade metadata

        Step 5. 🧾 Record to TradeManager  
            - Estimate commission  
            - Log trade details including latency, slippage, and intent metadata

        Step 6. 🔄 Update live risk metrics  
            - Trigger live_updater and drawdown_tracker to refresh risk state

        Step 7. 🧠 Save execution result  
            - Record result in context (status, reason, prices, timestamps, slippage, commission)

        Step 8. 📝 Write to audit log  
            - Persist simulated trade in audit trail

        Step 9. ✅ Confirm dry-run completion  
            - Log confirmation message to console or debug log
