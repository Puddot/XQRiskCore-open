KillSwitchManager — Multi-Level Lockdown Control
================================================

This module governs **all blocking mechanisms** in XQRiskCore.

It defines and enforces:
1. 🔐 Silent Mode  — Countdown-based cooling-off lock (asset/account level)
2. ⛔ KillSwitch    — Manual override lock (must be explicitly released)

All lock and release actions are fully auditable and timestamped.

⚠️ Source code intentionally withheld.  
✅ Live in production with structured logging.
