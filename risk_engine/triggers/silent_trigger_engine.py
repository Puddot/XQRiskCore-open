SilentTriggerEngine — End-of-Day Lockdown Logic
===============================================

This module runs at the end of each trading day to enforce **rule-based silent mode triggers**.

It evaluates:
- Daily / monthly return thresholds
- Consecutive account-level losses
- Asset-level risk patterns (drawdown, slippage, price drops)

Any trigger will result in **automatic cooling-off periods**, logged via structured audit trails.

⚠️ Source code withheld.  
✅ Active in production and tied to daily governance cycle.

        Step 1. 📊 Evaluate account-level triggers:

        - Rule A: Daily return < -5%  
            → Trigger 2-day account-wide silent mode

        - Rule B: Monthly return < -10%  
            → Trigger silent mode until end of month

        - Rule C: 3 consecutive losing days  
            → Trigger 1-day account silent mode

        Step 2. 📉 Evaluate asset-level risk conditions:

        For each asset:
        - Rule 1: drawdown_3d < -10%  
        - Rule 2: 3 consecutive down days  
        - Rule 3: position drawdown < -15%  
        - Rule 4: slippage > 0.5%  
        - Rule 5: intraday drop > 8%

        → If any rule is met, apply 7-day silent mode to the asset

        All triggered events:
        - Are logged with structured reason codes
        - Support audit traceability
