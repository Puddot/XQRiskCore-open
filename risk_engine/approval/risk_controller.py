RiskController — Multi-Factor Trade Approval Engine
====================================================

This module governs pre-trade risk evaluation and approval logic.

It evaluates:
- Volatility (GARCH)
- Value at Risk (VaR) and CVaR
- Market regime signal
- Internal risk score

Combined with user risk style (conservative / moderate / aggressive),  
it decides whether to approve, limit, or block trade intents.

Supports plug-in override classes:
- ConservativeRiskController
- AggressiveRiskController

⚠️ Source code withheld.  
✅ Actively used in trade gating and approval pipeline.

        Step 3. Unified Trade Approval Flow

        - For "sell" intents:
          • Auto-approve if position sufficient
          • Block if quantity > position

        - For "buy" intents:
          1. Estimate cost with slippage buffer
          2. Block if capital insufficient
          3. Fetch risk signals:
             - Volatility
             - VaR
             - Score
          4. Lookup client’s risk style thresholds
          5. Apply 3-factor rule-based logic:
             - Volatility too high → reject
             - VaR too negative → reject
             - Score too low → reject or limit
          6. Combine all factors into approval object:
             - approved: bool
             - reason: full reasoning text
             - sizing: recommended exposure sizing
