XQRiskCore - Daily Governance Cycle
===================================
System-level self-governing mechanism for end-of-day execution:

1. Update portfolio valuation and drawdown metrics  
2. Trigger daily risk mechanisms (e.g., Silent Mode, KillSwitch)  
3. Log system activity for audit trail  
4. Record daily performance metrics  
5. Snapshot risk and portfolio state  
6. Write strategy performance scores  
7. Save full updated state for next-day continuity

⚠️ Source code has been intentionally withheld.  
✅ System logic is fully live in production.
