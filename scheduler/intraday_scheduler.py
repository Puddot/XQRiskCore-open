XQRiskCore - Intraday Risk Monitoring Scheduler
===============================================

This module continuously loops to run **intraday risk scans** across all registered clients.

🔄 Core Responsibilities:
- Evaluate live market valuation
- Update asset-level and portfolio-level drawdown
- Trigger intraday risk logic (e.g., drawdown breach, Silent Mode entry)
- Log audit snapshots for periodic review
- Save updated portfolio and trigger state

⚠️ Source code withheld.  
✅ Live in production.
