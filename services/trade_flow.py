def run_trade_flow(client_ctx, intent):
    """
    Unified trade execution flow. Internally used across all trade sources.

    Steps:
    0. Emergency Guard Layer  
       - Block trades if flagged by real-time fail-safes (e.g. slippage spike, audit corruption)

    0a. Intraday Snapshot  
        - Capture latest price, slippage, drawdown, and exposure metrics for real-time enforcement

    0b. Silent Mode / KillSwitch Check  
        - Block if the asset or client is under cooling-off or lockdown

    1. Risk Assessment  
       - Evaluate updated VaR, drawdown, volatility metrics
       - Apply client-specific rules to approve or reject the trade

    2. Rejection Path  
       - If not approved: log rejection reason, trigger strategy throttler if applicable, record audit

    3. Execution  
       - Route trade to appropriate broker interface (via execution router)
       - Capture execution context and intraday metrics

    4a. Audit & FailSafe Check  
        - Ensure audit logs are correctly generated and internally verifiable
        - If audit fails: flag the trade for rollback or override tracking

    4b. Post-Trade Update  
        - Update portfolio state, save metrics, and reset strategy failure counters

    Returns:
        ExecutionContext: full trade record with result status, reason, signals, and audit trace
