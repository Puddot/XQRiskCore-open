        #   - Call external market API to get current price and timestamp
        #   - Skip assets with zero position

        # === 2. Retrieve historical price references ===
        #   - avg_price, current_price, lowest_price_since_entry
        #   - Used for drawdown and PnL calculations

        # === 3. Update current price & last_price_time ===
        #   - Store live price and timestamp into asset state

        # === 4. Update portfolio value (position * current price) ===
        #   - Aggregate each asset‚Äôs value into total account value

        # === 5. Update consecutive down days counter ===
        #   - If price < previous, increment counter
        #   - Else, reset to zero

        # === 6. Update lowest price since entry (drawdown_3d) ===
        #   - Track asset-level drawdown from entry to lowest observed price

        # === 7. Update unrealized drawdown percentage (drawdown_pct) ===
        #   - Calculate % loss from average entry price to current market price

        # === 8. Update account-level net value ===
        #   - Total = cash + all positions marked to market

        # === 9. Update peak account value (account_peak_value) ===
        #   - Track all-time-high value for drawdown benchmarking

        # === 10. Calculate account-level drawdown (account_drawdown_pct) ===
        #   - Based on current value vs. peak

        # === 11. Record last_updated timestamp ===
        #   - Use NY timezone timestamp to standardize update time
