"""
DrawdownTracker (Process Outline Only)
======================================

This module updates all drawdown-related metrics in the live portfolio state.

It operates independently of execution logic, and is triggered during scans, end-of-day updates, or post-trade evaluations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Full implementation withheld for security reasons.  
‚úÖ Production version is fully operational.

        # === Step 0: Prepare values ===
        # - Retrieve net portfolio value and previously recorded peak

        # === Step 1: Portfolio-level drawdown calculation ===
        # - If net value exceeds peak, reset peak
        # - Else, compute (net_value - peak_value) / peak_value
        # - Store in: self.state["account_drawdown_pct"]

        # === Step 2: Loop through each asset ===
        # For each held symbol, update:

        # --- 2.1 Unrealized drawdown (drawdown_pct) ---
        # - Based on current price vs. average entry price
        # - Set to 0 if price missing or avg_price <= 0

        # --- 2.2 3-day minimum drawdown (drawdown_3d) ---
        # - Based on current price vs. rolling minimum
        # - Used to trigger KillSwitch or Silent Mode

        # --- 2.3 Consecutive down days ---
        # - Count number of consecutive sessions where price < previous price
        # - Reset to 0 if current >= previous or if price missing

        # - Store updated values: drawdown_pct, drawdown_3d, consecutive_down_days

        # === Step 3: Timestamp the update ===
        # - Store NY timezone timestamp to: self.state["last_drawdown_check"]

        # === Step 4: Logging ===
        # - Print summary confirmation if in debug mode
